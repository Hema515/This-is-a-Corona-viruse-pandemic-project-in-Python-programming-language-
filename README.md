# Coronavirus Pandemic Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the spread and impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using real-world data. The focus is on understanding active cases, recovery cases, and total confirmed cases globally over time.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Objective
To provide insights into the number of active COVID-19 cases, recovery cases, and total confirmed cases worldwide, helping to track the pandemic's progression.

## Files
- `covid_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis
- `covid_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis (from sources like Kaggle or WHO)

## Key Insights
- Trends of active COVID-19 cases globally.
- Number of recovered patients over time.
- Total confirmed COVID-19 cases and their progression.
- Visualizations illustrate how the pandemic evolved across different regions.The "Covid-19 Impact Analysis" project uses Python's Dash library web 
deployment to create an interactive dashboard. 
• This dashboard visually represents key Covid-19 metrics such as total 
cases, active cases, recovered cases, and total deaths according to different 
states of India.  
 
• It also analyzes the availability of essential items like masks, sanitizers, and 
oxygen. The goal is to make complex pandemic data easy to understand 
through interactive visuals
